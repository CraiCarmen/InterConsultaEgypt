At a time when everything seems to be spinning faster, we are a constant partner. Nevertheless, since the founding of InterConsulta in 1964, we have never stopped. But, rather, we have reinvented ourselves time and time again and have moved forward with our clients.
The best proof of this is our customers, some of whom have been loyal to us for decades and over several generations.<br><br>

We started in Egypt since 1984 to 1999 and back again in 2017. We are providing services such as: Auditing, Accounts, Banking, Financial consulting, Insurance, Human resources and General consulting.
